"""
These files are my solutions to the exercises at www.practicepython.org.
The exercises have been a great way for me to supplement my other independent learning,
which consists of reading text books, blogs, reddit, stackexchange, and other tutorials.

Most of the code you will see was written by me. In some instances, code was copied from
the solutions page. In those cases, I've tried to add comments that state the code is copied.
Most copied code was then modified by me as I tested it out and learned how it worked.

I hope some progression in my skills is evident when I reach the end and look back at my work!
